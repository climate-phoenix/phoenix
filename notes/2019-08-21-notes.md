# Meeting 21th August 8:15pm

## Status

* Lukáš built a carbon dioxide emission map using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions.
* There are some values that are too high that need to be mapped to a 0-1 real range and then mapped to a color range.
* Some mapping between the country codes is not fully working (so some data is not shown).

## Ideas

* How can you help/CTA section
* Other data sources for the map
  * Amazon rainforest fire -> there is a hashtag connected with this, we can connect it with a Twitter feed
  
## Conclusion

About merging: just open a PR, Now deployment will automatically deploy it. Then we can discuss/review/merge it.

* We broadly collected and discussed next steps and wrote it down in issues that we assigned: https://github.com/climate-phoenix/map/issues.
